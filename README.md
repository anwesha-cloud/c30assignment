# Slingshot Box Knockdown (Matter.js) -2020

> ⚠️ Note: This is an old JavaScript project using Matter.js and p5.js, created to explore physics, constraints, and interactive object manipulation.
> This project is a browser-based physics game where the player can drag and release a ball attached to a slingshot to knock down stacked boxes.

Features:

Slingshot Mechanism: Drag and release a ball using the mouse.

Stacked Boxes: Multiple boxes arranged on platforms that react to collisions.

Physics Simulation: Uses Matter.js for realistic gravity, collisions, and constraints.

Reset Functionality: Press the spacebar to reattach the ball to the slingshot.
